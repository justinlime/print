* Elegoo Neptune 4
** Slicer
For some reason, the only slicer that doesnt fuck up my prints is Cura slicer
Download the preset profile from [[https://www.elegoo.com/pages/download][here]] (Im using the "New" option).

So far, I haven't had to modify any settings in the slicer software itself. Will try to use this software 
on linux, but for now its only on windows.

Prusa slicer with some rando's Elegoo Neptune 4 profile fucks up just about every single print.

** Usage
*** Leveling
Seems like you can choose the "auto-level" option in the settings, and it does it job well. Then
manually tune the z-offset to the thickness of a sheet of printer paper. You want to paper to scape and feel
tension, but not too much, should still be relatively easy to move the paper under the nozzle.
*** Print speed
This boi is fast as fuck but it shouldn't affect your print quality. Even with my wobbly ass table.
*** Notes
Wobbly table that its on right now shouldn't matter.
