* Notes for Elegoo Neptune 4
** General
If nothing in here helps, check out [[https://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide][this]] guide

Add the following to printer.cfg
[[./assets/bedmesg.png]]

** Leveling
Start with a clean bed, wash wish dish soap and water very thoroughly. 

To level, enter the "Level" menu on the printer. First calibrate the z-offset. Place a piece of paper between
the nozzle and the bed, there should be a slight amount of friction, but not too much. Once you have this confirmed,
enter the "Auxilary" leveling, and do the same for each of the four corner points. Go over each point multiple times,
since changing one point will affect another. After you save it should perform automatic leveling immedietly after.

Lastly, calibrate the z-offset one more time, and hit save.

The automaic calibration that gets run after the auxillary leveling creates a bed mesh to compensate for inconsistencies.
If you dont add the line from above in either printer.cfg or your gcode when your slicing, then the mesh wont even be used.

Check the WebGUI, if the bed mess is way too out of wack, try another leveling cycle.

** Slicer
For some reason, the only slicer that doesnt fuck up my prints is Cura slicer
Download the preset profile from [[https://www.elegoo.com/pages/download][here]] (Im using the "New" option).

So far, I haven't had to modify any settings in the slicer software itself. Will try to use this software 
on linux, but for now its only on windows.

Prusa slicer with some rando's Elegoo Neptune 4 profile fucks up just about every single print.

** Notes
*** Settings
If any settings are not visible, you can enable them in the settings visibility menu

*** Leveling
Seems like you can choose the "auto-level" option in the settings, and it does it job well. Then
manually tune the z-offset to the thickness of a sheet of printer paper. You want to paper to scape and feel
tension, but not too much, should still be relatively easy to move the paper under the nozzle.

MY WOBBLY ASS TABLE <SHOULDN'T> MAKE A DIFFENCE WITH THE LEVELING

** Issues
*** Top or bottom of print has noticable lines
Try enabling monotonic for top/bottom. Lines will still be there but less noticeable
Layers more than 1 probably wont make a difference
[[./assets/monotonic.png]]

Also, enabling ironing and monotonic ironing order
This will make the top layer look very smooth
[[./assets/ironing.png]]

*** Stringy prints, or lines are curling up, or has bubbles
Disable zhop, this might cause other issues (see directly below).
Simply lowering it might help.

*** Prints are scraping/look like crap
Some of my prints do just fine even with some agressive scrapage, but if its causing issues then
You might be over or under extruding if your prints look like shit, or if they are scraping constantly
[[./assets/extruder.jpg]]

Try messing with the flow settings in cura, specifically decreasing the flow on the inner and outer walls
[[./assets/flow.png]]


Also, make sure "Z Hop only over printed parts" is enabled, and try increasing the zhop height.

Or try lowering the speed.

*** Prints are coming up during the first layer 
Use glue you dumb mf
